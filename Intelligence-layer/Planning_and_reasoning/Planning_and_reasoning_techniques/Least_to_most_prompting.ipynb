    "Complex problems often overwhelm language models when presented all at once. A sophisticated question requiring multiple reasoning steps, domain knowledge, and careful integration of information can exceed the model's ability to handle everything simultaneously. This is particularly true when problems have hierarchical structure - solving the overall problem depends on first solving simpler sub-problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Least-to-Most prompting addresses this by explicitly decomposing complex problems into a sequence of simpler sub-problems, solving them from easiest to hardest, and using each solution as context for the next. The technique consists of two stages: decomposition (break the problem into ordered sub-problems) and sequential solving (solve each sub-problem using previous solutions as context). This builds up understanding incrementally rather than requiring the model to handle all complexity at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement Least-to-Most prompting to show how progressive problem decomposition improves reasoning on complex tasks. We will create a system that breaks down challenging questions into manageable pieces, solves them in order of increasing difficulty and builds each solution on previous ones. This approach is particularly effective for compositional reasoning, mathematical proofs, multi-hop question answering and any problem with natural hierarchical structure."

The decomposition forces systematic thinking that direct solving might miss.\n",

    "- Complex problems with natural sub-problems.\n",
