    "# Program-aided language models (PAL)\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving mathematical, logical or computational problems, language models face a fundamental challenge: they must perform precise calculations using imprecise natural language generation. While LLMs are remarkably good at understanding and reasoning about problems, they often struggle with exact arithmetic, complex algorithms, or multi-step calculations that require perfect precision at each step. A model might correctly identify that a problem requires computing 17 × 23 + 45, but then make an arithmetic error in the actual calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Program-Aided Language Models (PAL) address this limitation by leveraging what computers do best - executing code. Instead of asking the LLM to solve the problem directly through text generation, PAL prompts the model to write a program that solves the problem. The LLM handles the reasoning and problem decomposition (translating natural language to code logic), while a code interpreter handles the precise execution. This separation of concerns - LLM for understanding and structuring, interpreter for computation - dramatically improves accuracy on quantitative tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement PAL to demonstrate how code generation enhances reasoning reliability. We will build a system that takes natural language problems, generates Python code to solve them, executes that code safely, and presents the results. This approach is particularly valuable for mathematical word problems, data analysis tasks, algorithmic challenges, and any scenario where precise computation is essential."
