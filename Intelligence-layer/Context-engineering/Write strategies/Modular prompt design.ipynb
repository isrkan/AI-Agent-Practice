    "# Modular prompt design\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to structure system prompts as composable modules that can be combined based on task requirements. Traditional monolithic prompts become difficult to maintain and adapt as agents grow more complex. By breaking prompts into reusable modules, we create a flexible system that allows adapting context to specific needs while maintaining consistency across different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular prompt design is a **write strategy** for context production. It focuses on creating high-quality, well-structured context from the start. Each module is self-contained, focused on a single concern (identity, behavior, constraints), and can be composed without conflicts. This approach reduces redundancy, improves maintainability, and enables efficient token usage by including only what's needed for each specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides several key advantages:\n",
    "1. **Reusability**: Same modules can be used across different agent configurations\n",
    "2. **Maintainability**: Update a module once, and all prompts using it get updated\n",
    "3. **Testability**: Each module can be tested independently\n",
    "4. **Flexibility**: Easily adapt to different scenarios by mixing modules\n",
    "5. **Token efficiency**: Only include what is needed for each specific task\n",
    "6. **Version control**: Track changes to individual modules separately\n",
    "7. **A/B testing**: Compare different module combinations to optimize performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular prompt design is particularly valuable as our AI system grows in complexity, enabling us to manage dozens of agent variants without duplicating or manually maintaining large monolithic prompts."
