    "# Query-based retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Information retrieval for AI agents is rarely a simple matter of finding documents that match keywords. Production knowledge bases contain thousands or millions of documents with varying levels of relevance, authority, and freshness. A naive search might return technically matching documents that are outdated, from untrusted sources, or semantically off-target. The challenge is not just finding potential matches, but systematically filtering through multiple dimensions to identify the small subset of documents that truly deserve a place in the agent's context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query-based retrieval addresses this challenge through multi-stage filtering pipelines that progressively narrow the candidate set using different criteria. Rather than relying on a single similarity score, we combine semantic filters, metadata constraints, recency requirements, source authority ratings, and hybrid search strategies to select documents that are both semantically relevant and contextually appropriate. Each filter removes documents that fail specific quality or relevance criteria, ensuring that only the highest-quality, most pertinent information reaches the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore how to build sophisticated query-based retrieval systems as a select strategy for context engineering. We will examine how to implement semantic similarity filters that capture meaning beyond keywords, how to apply metadata filters for attributes like document type or category, how to enforce recency requirements for time-sensitive domains, how to score and prioritize based on source authority, and how to combine multiple retrieval strategies through hybrid search."

    "Metadata filters are precise and efficient because they operate on structured attributes rather than semantic similarity scores. They allow us to enforce hard requirements - for example, when handling a refund inquiry, we might require documents of type policy, or when troubleshooting a laptop issue, we might exclude documents categorized under tablets. These filters dramatically improve precision by removing semantically similar but contextually inappropriate documents."
