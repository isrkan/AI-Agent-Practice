# LLM Integration

LLM integration is the process of connecting our AI agent system to a large language model, providing the core reasoning and language understanding capabilities. The LLM acts as the "brain" of the agent, interpreting user requests, generating responses, and formulating plans. The choice and integration of LLM will significantly influence the agent's performance, cost, and behavior.


### Implementation guide
Follow these steps to successfully integrate an LLM into the agent's system.

#### Step 1: Choose the LLM
Select an LLM that aligns with the system requirements and design. Consider the following factors:
* **Proprietary vs. open-source:**
    * **Proprietary (e.g., OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini):**
        * **Pros:** Generally state-of-the-art performance, advanced capabilities (multimodality, large context) and managed infrastructure.
        * **Cons:** Higher cost, potential data privacy concerns and reliance on an external API.
    * **Open-source (e.g., Llama, Gemma, Mistral):**
        * **Pros:** Greater control over data, fine-tuning capabilities, potential for lower cost on self-hosted infrastructure and community support.
        * **Cons:** Requires significant hardware resources, can be challenging to manage and may not match the performance of top proprietary models.
* **API vs. local deployment:**
    * **API-based:** Access via a cloud provider's API. The provider handles all infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance.
    * **Local/self-hosted:** Offers full control, better data privacy, and can be more cost-effective for high-volume use cases, but requires a local or dedicated server with a GPU to run the model, so need significant hardware and maintenance.
* **Model capabilities:** Ensure the model supports critical features for our agent's goals, such as:
    * **Performance and accuracy:** Evaluate the model's performance on relevant benchmarks or domain-specific tasks. Look for metrics like accuracy and hallucination rate to ensure the model provides reliable and factual outputs.
    * **Function calling /tool use:** The ability to generate structured output for calling external tools.
    * **Context window:** The maximum number of tokens the model can process at once. A larger window allows for more extensive memory and retrieval context.
    * **Customization capability (fine-tuning):** If our agent needs to specialize in a specific domain or tone, consider models that can be easily fine-tuned on our custom dataset.
    * **Safety:** Consider the model's built-in safety features, such as its ability to detect and refuse harmful, illegal, or unethical content. Proprietary models often have more robust pre-trained safety guardrails.
    * **Latency & throughput:** The speed at which the model generates responses.
    * **Cost:** Pricing models vary (e.g., per-token, per-request).
* **Model size:** Model size is measured by the number of parameters. Generally, a larger model has a greater capacity to learn and perform complex reasoning tasks, while a smaller model is more efficient.
* **Ease of integration and ecosystem:** A mature ecosystem with comprehensive documentation, community support, and pre-built integrations can significantly simplify development.
* **Use case fit:** The ideal model depends on what our agent needs to do.
    * **Simple Q&A or content generation:** Smaller, more cost-effective models may suffice.
    * **Complex reasoning & multi-step tasks:** We will need a more powerful, large-scale model with strong reasoning capabilities.
    * **Coding or data analysis:** Look for models specifically trained on code or structured data.
    * **Creative Tasks:** Choose models known for their creative or diverse outputs.

#### Step 2: Set up API connections and authentication
Once we have selected our LLM, set up the necessary connection and authentication.
1.  **Install required libraries:** Install the official Python client library for the chosen LLM providers (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`, `google-generativeai`). For more complex applications, consider using a high-level LLM integration framework like `LangChain`, `LlamaIndex` or `Haystack`. These frameworks abstract away common complexities, making it easier to manage memory, chains, and tool usage.
2.  **Obtain and secure API keys:**
      * Create an account with the LLM provider.
      * Generate a new API key.
      * **Security Best Practice:** **NEVER hard-code API keys** directly into our source code. Use environment variables or a secure secret management system to store sensitive credentials.

#### Step 3: Fine-tune the model (Optional)
If using a model that supports fine-tuning (such as open-source models like LLaMA, Mistral, or proprietary models like OpenAI, Gemini, or Claude), we may customize it for better performance on our specific domain or task. Steps to follow:
1. Collect domain-specific training data: Format examples in prompt-response pairs or structured instruction datasets.
2. Preprocess and clean the data: Ensure data consistency, remove noisy examples, and format inputs properly.
3. Perform the fine-tuning.
4. Train and validate: Monitor loss and evaluate on validation examples.
5. Deploy the fine-tuned model: Use the fine-tuned version instead of the base model in our integration logic.

**Tips:**
* Fine-tune only if you have consistent examples that demonstrate a performance gap with the base model.
* For minor tweaks (e.g., tone or format), try prompt engineering or system prompts before committing to tuning.

#### Step 4: Create a basic prompt-response loop
Write a simple script to test the connection and verify that the LLM is working as expected. This script will represent the most fundamental interaction with our agent's brain.

#### Step 5: Test with simple queries
Run scripts with a variety of simple queries to confirm:
  * The connection is stable.
  * The LLM provides coherent and relevant responses.
  * There are no authentication or permission errors.

Test with different types of questions: factual queries, creative requests, and simple commands.

#### Step 6: Create a modular LLM structure
For scalable and maintainable applications, especially when using different models for different tasks (e.g., summarization, RAG, classification), adopt a modular directory structure for the LLMs. This pattern centralizes LLM management, making it easy to swap models or providers without extensive code changes. Create a dedicated `llms` directory in the project with the following structure:

```
├── llms/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── gemini_client.py      # Gemini-based LLM wrappers        
│   ├── openai_client.py      # OpenAI-based LLM wrappers
│   ├── huggingface_client.py # Hugging Face-based LLM wrappers
│   └── llm_registry.py       # Central registry or factory for all LLMs
```

1. **Client files (e.g., `llms/openai_client.py`):** Each client file will contain functions to instantiate specific models from a provider for a given task. This keeps your model configurations organized.

    ```python
    # llms/openai_client.py
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

    def get_openai_summarization_llm():
        """Returns a ChatOpenAI instance configured for summarization."""
        return ChatOpenAI(
            model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
            temperature=0.3,
            max_tokens=1024
        )

    def get_openai_coding_llm():
        """Returns a ChatOpenAI instance configured for code generation."""
        return ChatOpenAI(
            model_name="gpt-4o",  # Example: using a different model for a different task
            temperature=0.2,
            max_tokens=2048
        )
    ```

    We can do the same for other providers like Gemini or HuggingFace.
2. **LLM registry (`llms/llm_registry.py`):** This file acts as a central factory or registry that exposes the correct LLM instance based on the task name. This pattern decouples the rest of our application from the specific LLM implementation.

    ```python
    # llms/llm_registry.py
    from llms.openai_client import get_openai_summarization_llm
    from llms.gemini_client import get_gemini_chat_llm

    LLM_TASK_MAP = {
        "summarization": get_openai_summarization_llm,
        "chat": get_gemini_chat_llm,
        # more tasks/models
    }

    def get_llm(task_name: str):
        """
        Retrieves the correct LLM instance for a given task.
        
        Args:
            task_name: The name of the task (e.g., "summarization", "chat").
            
        Returns:
            An instantiated LLM model.
        """
        return LLM_TASK_MAP[task_name]()
    ```
