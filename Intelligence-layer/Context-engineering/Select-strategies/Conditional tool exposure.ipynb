    "# Conditional tool exposure\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern AI agents often have access to dozens or even hundreds of tools - functions they can call to retrieve information, perform actions, or interact with external systems. While this versatility is powerful, it creates a significant challenge: every tool loaded into the agent's context consumes tokens and increases decision complexity. When presented with 50 tools, the model must evaluate each one to determine relevance, wasting cognitive resources and tokens on options that are clearly inapplicable to the current task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional tool exposure solves this problem by dynamically selecting which tools to make available based on the current context. Rather than overwhelming the agent with every possible capability, we expose only the subset of tools that are relevant to the task type, user permissions, conversation state, or other contextual factors. This reduces both the token overhead of tool descriptions and the cognitive burden of tool selection, leading to faster, more accurate tool use and lower operational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore how to implement conditional tool exposure as a select strategy for context engineering. We will examine how to categorize tools by task type and permission level, how to dynamically select tool subsets based on context, how to measure the impact on decision quality and token efficiency, and how to build production-ready tool routing systems."

    "## Understanding the tool overload problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Before implementing conditional exposure, we need to understand the baseline problem. When agents have access to many tools, they face two key challenges. First, every tool description consumes tokens in the context window, reducing space available for actual conversation and reasoning. Second, more tools mean more options to evaluate during each decision, increasing the likelihood of selecting suboptimal or incorrect tools.\n",

    "To demonstrate this, we will create a comprehensive tool suite representing different functional areas of a customer service system. Each tool has a name, description, and implementation, all of which must be loaded into context when available to the agent. As the tool count grows, so does the overhead."
