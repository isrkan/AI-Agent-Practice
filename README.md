## Layer Descriptions

### Foundation-layer
Core building blocks for AI agents:
- **LLMs/**: API-based (OpenAI, Gemini) and open-source (LLaMA) integrations.
- **Memory/**: In-memory and Redis-based persistence for session and long-term memory.
- **Tool_use/**: function calling examples and MCP server implementations.

### Behavior-layer
Shapes agent responses and output formatting:
- **Prompt-engineering/**: Prompt techniques and AI agent personas.
- **Structured-output/**: Pydantic models for schema-based generation.

### Intelligence-layer
Advanced reasoning and knowledge retrieval:
- **RAG-system/**: RAG techniques.
- **Context-engineering/**: Context management strategies across write, select, transform, isolate and refresh patterns.
- **Planning_and_reasoning/**: Thinking and reasoning techniques.

### Architecture-and-orchestration-layer
Complex workflow orchestration and agent coordination:
- **Agent-loop-and-control-flow/**: workflow patterns and agentic design patterns.

### Safety-layer
Guardrails integration with Qualifire for prompt injection detection, PII protection, and content safety.

## Purpose
Provide hands-on implementations, tutorials, and best practices for AI agent development across multiple layers of complexity.
