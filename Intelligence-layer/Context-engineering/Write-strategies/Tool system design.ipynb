    "# Tool system design\n",
    "\n",
    "When AI agents need to interact with the outside world such as querying databases, calling APIs, performing calculations or accessing real-time information, they rely on tools. While tool integration extends agent capabilities dramatically, poorly designed tools can become a liability. Ambiguous names confuse agents about which tool to use, unclear parameter specifications lead to errors, and verbose descriptions waste precious context window space. The result is agents that struggle to select the right tool, invoke it correctly or understand what it returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool system design is fundamentally a context engineering challenge. Every tool name, parameter definition, and description contributes to the context that guides the agent's behavior. Well-designed tools act as clear, self-documenting interfaces that maximize the agent's ability to solve problems while minimizing the tokens required to explain how. This means choosing names that immediately convey purpose, structuring parameters with validation that prevents errors before they occur, and writing descriptions that are concise yet comprehensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore techniques for designing tool systems that agents can use reliably and efficiently. We will examine how to establish clear naming conventions that reflect tool purpose, structure parameters using self-documenting Pydantic schemas, write concise yet comprehensive descriptions, include strategic usage examples, organize tools into logical categories, and maximize information density while minimizing token usage."

A well-named tool communicates its purpose instantly, while a poorly named tool forces the agent to read full descriptions or worse, guess incorrectly.

Without clear schemas, agents must guess at parameter types, whether fields are required or optional, what values are valid, and how parameters relate to each other.

Pydantic schemas solve this by making parameter contracts explicit, providing automatic validation, and generating clear documentation that agents can understand.\n",
