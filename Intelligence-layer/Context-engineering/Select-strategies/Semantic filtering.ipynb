    "# Semantic filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "As AI agents grow more sophisticated, they accumulate vast amounts of information in memory systems, knowledge bases, and document repositories. The challenge is not merely storing this information, but intelligently selecting which pieces are relevant for any given task. Loading everything into context is wasteful and counterproductive - it consumes precious tokens, dilutes focus on what truly matters, and can even confuse the model by introducing irrelevant or contradictory information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic filtering addresses this challenge by using vector similarity to identify and select only the information that is semantically related to the current task or query. Unlike keyword matching, which relies on exact text overlap, semantic filtering understands meaning through embeddings - dense vector representations that capture conceptual relationships. This allows the system to recognize that \"refund request\" and \"return merchandise\" are semantically similar even though they share no common words, or that a customer asking about \"laptop overheating\" should see documentation about \"thermal management\" and \"cooling systems.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore how to implement semantic filtering as a select strategy for context engineering. We will examine how embeddings capture semantic relationships, how vector similarity measurements identify relevant information, how similarity thresholds control precision and recall, and how to integrate semantic filtering into retrieval systems using FAISS vector stores."

    "Semantic filtering truly shines when integrated into an agent's context selection pipeline. Rather than loading entire knowledge bases or memory stores into every request, the agent dynamically retrieves only the most relevant information based on the current query. This approach minimizes token usage, improves response quality by reducing noise, and enables agents to work with knowledge bases far larger than could fit in any context window.\n",

    "The integration pattern is straightforward: receive user query, use semantic search to identify relevant knowledge, construct focused context from filtered results, and generate response using only pertinent information. This creates a virtuous cycle where better context selection leads to better responses, which in turn builds user trust in the system's ability to understand and address their needs."
